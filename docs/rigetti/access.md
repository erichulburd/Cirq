# Access and Authentication

As of the writing of this documentation, users must [request access](https://pyquil-docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/migration.html) to obtain credentials for accessing Rigetti QPU hardware. However, this Cirq-Rigetti integration enables quantum software developers to run against the pyQuil
[QVM](https://pyquil-docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/migration.html), which users can use as a drop-in replacement for Rigetti QPU hardware.

## Next steps

If you already have access to Rigetti QCS, make sure to read about [getting started with the Rigetti QCS JupyterLab IDE](https://docs.rigetti.com/en/getting-started-with-your-ide/jupyterlab-ide). Otherwise, learn about installing pyQuil [dependencies](dependencies.md) locally to run against the pyQuil QVM.

Once you are situated, make sure to check out the integration [examples](examples.md).
